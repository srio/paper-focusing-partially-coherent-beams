\begin{abstract}
We simulate the focusing of partial coherent beams produced by fourth-generation storage rings using wave optics and coherent mode decomposition of the undulator radiation. The focus produced by a focusing system with an entrance slit is shifted, and its size is enlarged, as compared to the predictions of geometrical optics. This depends on the slit aperture that is used to control the coherent fraction. The pairing of two transfocators to assure a fixed focal position is studied in terms of beam sizes and coherent fraction. The results show that the image of the partially coherent source (an undulator in a low emittance storage ring) produced by a focusing system is a non-trivial function of the aperture used to control the coherence fraction.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


Recent fourth-generation storage-ring-based X-ray synchrotron sources deliver photon beams with high brilliance and coherence. The transversal coherence of these beams is highly improved, in particular in the horizontal direction, with respect to previous 3$^{\text{rd}}$ generation sources. This has a beneficial impact for many applications requiring coherent beams, such as X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, coherent diffraction imaging, propagation-based phase-contrast imaging, and ptychography (see, e.g. \cite{paganin_book}). On the other side, preserving wavefront quality requires better quality materials and optical surfaces in the active beamline components such as mirrors, gratings, crystals and lenses \cite{Yabashi, Roth2017}. Moreover, the interaction of the coherent beam with the optical elements produce diffraction that do affect their focusing power and resolving power of these elements.

Let us consider the case of an ideally focusing system of focal length $f$ (made by a mirror or lens that focuses the source into the image plane). The position of the focus with respect to the focusing element $q$ can be estimated by the lens equation $f^{-1}=p^{-1}+q^{-1}$, with $p$ the source-element distance. If the numerical aperture (NA) of the beam is reduced (for example by the finite dimension of the lens, mirror or by using a slit) the position and also the dimensions of the focal point changes due to diffraction. It has been shown \cite{Tanaka:85} that the focal position created by a Gaussian beam ``moves" towards the lens position when NA reduces. This shifting of the focal position is also relevant for synchrotron beamlines, as demonstrated by \citeasnoun{westfahl}. These authors noticed a shift of the horizontal focal position upstream from the position given by geometrical optics (see Fig. 7 in \citeasnoun{westfahl}) when the horizontal acceptance is reduced by a slit. Their numeric results from wavefront propagation using SRW \cite{codeSRW} including partial coherence agree with an analytical Gaussian Shell-model.

The diffraction effect at the slits and finite size of the optical elements not only shifts the focal point, but also changes the focal dimensions, as we will see later. These facts are critical when designing beamlines with several coupled focusing elements. We study this phenomenon applied to the project for the new ID18 beamline at the upgraded EBS-ESRF storage ring. This beamline will produce highly coherent beams of variable cross section at the sample position. Two refractive systems (transfocators) are paired to allow a varying focal size, whereas a slit placed upstream from the transfocators is used to control the coherent fraction. The optical matching of the transfocators is studied in detail, and it is strongly correlated with the slit aperture (or coherent fraction). The performances of such systems are calculated applying coherent mode decomposition (CMD) of the undulator beams and propagating the coherent modes. A high efficiency CMD software is used, that implements a 1D model, therefore studying separately the horizontal and vertical planes. 

The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:onelens} analyzes the focusing of partially coherent beams with a single refractive system (lens). Section~\ref{sec:twolenses} discusses the pairing of two refractive systems. Section~\ref{sec:complete-beamline} shows the details of simulations for four selected cases. We finish with a general discussion in Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and  concluding remarks in Section~\ref{sec:summary}. 


\section{Effect of the numerical aperture in the focal position using a single lens}\label{sec:onelens}

This section analyzes an idealized case of focusing a synchrotron beam with a transfocator. In many beamlines the beam coherence fraction is increased by reducing the aperture of an entrance slit. Beam with high coherent fractions are affected by diffraction effects originated at the slit aperture and at the lens (finite dimension and surface errors). The focal position changes, as well as the focal dimensions, thus modifying the focusing properties of the transfocator. 

\subsection{Preliminary works.}

% The case of a Gaussian beam focused by a lens with a physical aperture modifying the numerical aperture has been thoroughly studied (see e.g., \cite{Tanaka:85}, and references therein).
When a coherent Gaussian beam is cropped by the slit aperture, the beam waist moves towards the lens. Closing the slit affects the focus position, that moves more and more to the lens position, which is reached at the limit of zero aperture. The change of the waist position happens when the Fresnel number\footnote{
The factor 4 in the denominator comes from the choice of $a$ as the aperture size, thus $a/2$ is used for the radius.} is smaller than one
\begin{equation}
    N_F = \frac{a^2}{4 p \lambda}  < 1,
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the distance from the aperture to the lens. We use a fixed $p$ and modify $N_F$ by changing the aperture.  

After \citeasnoun{Belland:82}, there are three possible regimes 
\begin{enumerate}
\item when diffraction effects are negligible, the
characteristics of the Gaussian beam are unchanged
behind the aperture ($N_F>1$),
\item when the Gaussian
beam is weakly diffracted, it looks in the far-field always as a Gaussian beam, with slightly different characteristics; this is valid for $N_F$ larger than a given $N_0$ and smaller than one,
\item when the diffraction effects are large ($N_F<N_0$),
the diffracted beam is no longer Gaussian.
\end{enumerate}

The transition (1) to (2) will move the focus towards the lens. The transition (2) to (3) depends on $N_0$, a value difficult to estimate analytically. A more general case happens when the numerical aperture is controlled by a slit placed at at distance $p_a$ upstream from the lens. 
In this case, the Fresnel number can be generalized as $N_F=a^2 p / (4 \lambda (p-p_a)^2)$. The focus will shift to the position $q'=f p_a/(p_a-f)$, a position given by the geometrical optics when the source is placed at the slit position. 

An optical system that focuses a partially coherent synchrotron beam in the horizontal plane is analyzed in detail by \citeasnoun{westfahl}. The focal system is in almost 1:1 magnification, and a shift of the focal position towards the mirror is produced when closing a slit placed just before the mirror. Analytical analyses using the Gaussian Shell-model and numerical partial coherent (multielectron) calculations with SRW \cite{codeSRW} agree in the obtained results. The analyses revealed a different shift for the two photon energies analyzed (3 and 9 keV). The good agreement between GSM and SRW is justified by a relatively low horizontal coherent fraction at the source (about 21\% at 3 keV and 12\% at 9 keV).
 
 
 \subsection{Changes in focal position and size as a function of the slit opening}
 
Let us consider an aperture of dimension $a$ placed between the source and a lens, at a distance $p_a$ from the lens ($p_a < p$). The lens is set to focus the source into an image plane at $q$ downstream from the lens. Following the geometrical optics, the position of the focal plane is not changed if the aperture $a$ changes. The focal size is $Ms$  when the aperture size $a$ is larger than the source size $s$ ($M=q/p$ is the optical magnification). But if $a<s$ the aperture obscures part of the source like if it was an ``effective" smaller source. However, the position of the waist is not modified. When the beam has a high coherence, these results predicted by geometrical optics are insufficient. This section presents numerical simulations of the focused beam (changes in focal position and focal size) when considering the partial coherent undulator emission. 
We then compute the beam evolution using wave optics. The insertion device source is a U18 undulator (period $\lambda_u=$~\SI{18}{\milli\meter}) with $N_u$~=~138 periods. The gap is tuned to have the first harmonic at $E$~=7~keV (deflecting parameter $K$~=~1.851). 

\subsubsection{Full coherence} We first suppose an ideal storage ring with zero emittance, therefore producing a fully coherent emission. A Be lens of radius $R=$~ \SI{0.2}{\milli\meter} ($f=$~\SI{14.35}{\meter} at 7 keV) is placed $p=$~\SI{65}{\meter}, and a slit of variable aperture $a$ is placed at $p_a=$~\SI{29}{\meter} upstream from the lens. The beam at the slit plane has a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) $a_\text{FWHM}=$~\SI{565}{\micro\meter}. The aperture is open at $a=n \times a_\text{FWHM}$ with different values of $n$ covering from fully opening to a very narrow aperture. The refracted beam is analyzed at different positions from the lens by calculating the FWHM of the intensity distribution. At the focal position the FWHM presents a minimum. 

\begin{figure}\label{fig:oneTFund}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/oneTF_UndSource_RectSlit_R200um.eps}
\caption{Evolution of the size of a coherent undulator beam cropped by a slit and focused by a lens of $R$=~\SI{0.2}{\milli\meter} 
The plot shows the FWHM of the beam  as a function of the distance from the lens. The aperture is open at $a = n \times a_\text{FWHM}$ with different values of $n$ (shown in the legend) and $a_\text{FWHM}$ = \SI{565}{\micro\meter} (the beam FWHM at the aperture plane). The focal positions given by geometrical optics are represented for the source placed wither at the ID position (yellow vertical line) or at the slit position (blue vertical line).
The Fresnel number $N_F$ calculated at the slit plane is also marked in the legend.
}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:oneTFund} shows the evolution of the beam after being focused by the lens. With the open slit the geometrical optics give a focal position $q=$~\SI{18.4168}{\meter} (source at the ID position, distant $p$ from the lens) and $q_a=$~\SI{28.4089}{\meter} (source at slit position, distant $p_a$ from lens). It can be noticed that for $n\ge$~1 (Fresnel number $N_F\ge$~35) the situation does not change with respect the open slit because the cropping by the slit is negligible. For $n=0.5$ ($N_F=8.7$, brown line) the FWHM of the focal size increases and the depth of focus also increases, manifested in a flat depression. For smaller values of $n$ and $N_F$ the minimum shifts to higher distances (e.g., $n=0.1$ red line) and becomes less pronounced. For $n$ = 0.05 (green line), a small beam size is found again close to the $q_a$ position, but it presents a twin minimum due to the interference fringes found in the intensity distributions. Both minima converge to a the $q_a$ position for $n\le$~0.01 (orange line). 

When the focal distance of the lens is reduced (using lenses with smaller radius, or piling several lenses), the $q$ and $q_a$ positions shift to shorter distances, and  $|q-q_a|$ also reduces. They converge to a single position: the lens focal length $q=q_a=f$. This happens when both source-lens and slit-lens distances can be considered at infinite. 

The dimension of the waist can be calculated using geometrical concepts only for the limiting cases of waist at $q$ and $q_a$. For the waist at $q$, the beam size is the source size times its magnification (ratio between lens-waist distance and lens-source distance). Similarly, for the waist at $q_a$, the beam size is the slit aperture times the magnification (now computed as the ratio between lens-waist distance and slit-lens distance). This has been verified numerically (not shown). However, for intermediate slit apertures, where the waist position is in between $q$ and $q_a$, the waist size is different to that predicted by geometric optics.
Indeed, it can be observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:oneTFund} that for these intermediate slit apertures that crop the beam, the waist size is larger than those found at limiting positions $p$ and $p_a$.
This is an important fact: A good focusing, i.e., a very small beam size is only obtained in the limiting cases of open slit and almost-closed slit. This means that for a fully coherent beam, the slit disturbs the focusing and should be avoided. The diffraction at the slit creates an an spurious divergence that affects the lens power. 

The calculation shown in Figure~\ref{fig:oneTFund} refers for the zero emittance case (complete coherence, or $CF_h=CF_v=1$). Next section extends these results to the more realistic case of finite emittance.

\subsubsection{Partial coherence} The mission of the slit is to improve beam coherence (increase coherent fraction). For usual photon energies (5-25~keV)  the slit must be almost closed to gain coherence in old storage rings like ESRF-1 ($CF<10^{-3}$), thus forming a secondary source. For storage rings like EBS, with $CF > 10^{-2}$, the selection of the slit aperture $a$ is crucial: the slit must be closed until the the desired $CF$ is obtained, but not more, because it not only reduces intensity but also deteriorates the focusing.

    \label{fig:cf_vs_aperture}
\end{figure}

We used the EBS-ESRF emittance values\footnote{We used over this work the following values of electron beam sizes at the center of the straight section: $\sigma_x=~\SI{29.7}{\micro\meter}$,
$\sigma_{x'}=~\SI{4.37}{\micro\radian}$,
$\sigma_y=~\SI{5.29}{\micro\meter}$,
$\sigma_{y'}=~\SI{1.89}{\micro\radian}$, corresponding to beam emittances:  $\epsilon_x=~\SI{130}{\pico\meter \radian}$,
$\epsilon_y=~\SI{10}{\pico\meter \radian}$, and beta functions
$\beta_x=~\SI{6.8}{\meter}$,
$\beta_y=~\SI{2.8}{\meter}$
}
to perform the coherent mode decomposition of the undulator source.
This is done for the horizontal and vertical directions, resulting coherent fractions (at 7 keV) of $CF_h=$13\% and $CF_v=$58\%, for the horizontal and vertical directions. These values are much higher than for the old ESRF-1 source, but still low to justify approximating the beam by a coherent beam. Therefore, we propagated a number of modes large enough to contain more than 99\% of the source intensity (36 modes in H and 8 in V). The illumination at the entrance slit plane is \SI{610}{\micro\meter} in H times \SI{566}{\micro\meter} in V. The slit aperture is used to tune the coherence of the beam: closing the slit increases the $CF$. In the limit (zero aperture) the beam after the slit is fully coherent ($CF=1$), but obviously with zero intensity. The choice of the right slit aperture comes from a compromise between coherence and flux. Figure~\ref{fig:cf_vs_aperture} shows the $CF$ after of the H and V 1D beams after the slit for different slit apertures. From this figure we select the apertures to be used in the following simulations. We selected a photon energy of \SI{7}{keV}. A first value of $CF_h=CF_v=$ 90\% in both horizontal and vertical (thus with a combined 2D  $CF=CF_h CF_v=$ 81\%) is obtained with slit apertures of
$a_h$ =~\SI{40.3}{\micro\meter}, and 
$a_v$ =~\SI{227}{\micro\meter} (horizontal and vertical, respectively). A second value of  $CF_h=CF_v=$ 70\% (thus 2D $CF$ of about 50\%), corresponds to 
$a_h$ =~\SI{85.1}{\milli\meter}, and 
$a_v$ =~\SI{506.7}{\milli\meter}. The case of the ``open" slit that does not crop the beam is also included (this is obtained, for example, with $a_h$ =~\SI{1}{\milli\meter} and $a_v$ =~\SI{1.5}{\milli\meter}).

    Full lines correspond to the partial coherent (multimode) beam, whereas the dashed lines correspond to the full coherent beam (first mode). Different slit apertures are used for obtaining different coherent fraction after the slits (marked in legend).
    }
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:oneTFundPartialCoherence} shows the focal size along the optical axis for these apertures in the horizontal and vertical planes. We calculated the case of the partially coherent beam (multi-mode, solid lines) and also the case of a fully coherent beam (only the first coherent mode, dashed lines). We observe that the focal positions (the minima of the plot lines) do not change significantly when passing from full to partial coherence. However, the focal dimension changes significantly in the horizontal direction for cases with $CF_h\le$ 70\%. In the vertical, where the beam at the source was more coherent there is no differences in sizes when going from full (dashed lines) to partial coherence (solid lines).

Looking to the focal position shift versus slit aperture we find important differences in the horizontal and vertical. The cropping of the beam by the slit is important in horizontal as we need to increase the $CF_h$ from the source (13\%) to values required by the experiments, usually larger than 50\%. This produces a gradual shift of the focal position from the position of the geometrical image of the ID source (black line in panel a)) to the geometrical image of the slit (red line in panel a)). However, in the vertical plane, the slit crops the beam only slightly, and closing the slit to go from the source $CF_v$ = 58\% to values up to 90\% does not produce any focal shift from the position of the geometrical image of the ID source. Only when the slit is very closed (e.g., $a_v$ =~\SI{25}{\micro\meter}, red curve) the focal position shifts to the geometrical image of the slit. This case is in principle not interesting experimentally as it reduces the intensity from an already quite coherent beam ($CF_v$~= 90\%). 

% In this section, we have supposed that the 2D beam can be separated in two 1D beams, for H and V directions. No other approximations were made: we used the full undulator source, performed coherent mode decomposition, used an aperture with a rectangular function, and used a Be lens with the real parabolic profile (with thickness $t=$~\SI{50}{\micro\meter} and aperture \SI{1}{\milli\meter}). 



\section{Pairing two transfocators}\label{sec:twolenses}

%http://lpc1.clpccd.cc.ca.us/lpc/molander/PDFs/Twolenses.pdf

We study here an optical system composed by two lenses (lens-1 with focal length $f_1$ and lens-2 with $f_2$) separated by a distance $D$. Following \citeasnoun{Goodman85}, the relationship between object-to-lens-1 distance $p_1$ and the lens-2-to-image distance $q_2$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twolens}
    D-(f_1+f_2)=\frac{f_1^2}{p_1-f_1} + \frac{f_2^2}{q_2-f_2}.
\end{equation}

The global magnification is the product of the magnification of the individual lenses. It can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:magnification}
    M=M_1 M_2=\frac{1-q_2/f_2}{1-p_1/f_1}.
\end{equation}

The magnification is not dependent on $D$, however the length of the optical system $L=p_1+D+q_2$ will change if one changes the focal distances of the lenses. For a constant $L$ one can change magnification by changing the inter-lenses distance $D$ (zoom effect). In a synchrotron beamline using transfocators, the magnification can be changed by varying the focal lengths of the transfocators (by adding or removing individual or group of lenses in the transfocator) \cite{Vaughan:kv5084}.

We analyze the optical design of a focusing system that uses two transfocators, and how to configure it for the desired focal size or magnification. 

% We start using the oversimplified assumptions of geometrical optics, for then using wave optics simulations with the focusing system illuminated by a partial coherent beam.

The two transfocators in use are idealized as two real beryllium lenses of variable curvature radius $R_1$ and $R_2$ that correspond to focal distances $f_1$ and $f_2$ ($f=R/(2 \delta)$, with $\delta=$~6.96 10$^{-6}$ for Be at \SI{7}{keV}). A slit of aperture $a_h$ in horizontal and $a_v$ in vertical is placed upstream the lens-1. The positions of the elements is determined by room constraints and are considered fixed (although different values could be studied). We set the distances matching the requirements of the EBS-ESRF ID18 beamline (see Table~\ref{table:id18parameters}), and we analyzed the system at a photon energy of \SI{7}{keV}. We study the variation of the spot size as a function of the focal distances. The final goal is to get the desired focal size by selecting the configuration of the transfocators (the focal length and the particular combination of lenses to approach it). 

For fixed distances $p_1$, $D$ and $q_2$, and also a given value of $f_1$, one can calculate analytically $f_2$ using  equation~(\ref{eq:twolens}) and the corresponding magnification $M$ in the framework of geometrical optics. Taking $f_1$ as variable parameter,  
Fig.~\ref{fig:analytical}a shows the trajectories of $f_2$ as a function of a variable $f_1$. In this plot we eliminated possible values of $f_2<0$ that correspond to the second divergent (defocusing) lens, an option not available in a typical transfocator.  
The choice of one pair $(f_1,f_2)$ from these curves guarantees that the focus is at the sample position ($L=p_1+D+q_2$~= \SI{200}{\meter} from source). Fig.~\ref{fig:analytical}b shows the theoretical magnification $|M|$ and the theoretical image sizes are in Fig.~\ref{fig:analytical}c. 

Figure~\ref{fig:f1f2map} shows the value of the $(f_1,f_2)$ map calculated numerically. For each $F_1$ value, we can select from the map $f_2$ value that produces the best focus (which has a minimum FWHM or a maximum peak intensity). 

The $(f_1,f_2)$ curves depend strongly on the slit aperture in the horizontal, because of the low $CF_h$ of the source (12\%) is highly increased by the slit. In the vertical the source is more coherent ($CF_v$~=~58\%) therefore the slit improves the $CF_v$  and there is not much change in the trajectories up to values of 90\%. However, in the case of a slit with $a_v$~=~\SI{25}{\micro\meter} that is acting as a pinhole the trajectories (red line) approach the results of the geometrical optics considering the source at the slit position.

Figure~\ref{fig:focalSizes} shows the calculated focal sizes. Analytical values (dashed and dotted lines), based on geometrical optics, use  equation~(\ref{eq:magnification}). They do not reproduce correctly values of beam sizes calculated numerically with wave optics. It can be concluded that the analytical values have very limited applicability, at least in the configurations studied.
In the horizontal direction, for slit apertures $a_h>$~\SI{40}{\micro\meter} the sizes change considerably for small changes in $a_h$. The focusing characteristics of the system depends highly on the diffraction effects produced at the slit. For the slit $a_h$~=~\SI{40.3}{\micro\meter} ($CF_h=$~90\%) the focal size can vary from roughly 10 to 50 microns.  In vertical the focal size can be changed from 5 to 100 \SI{}{\micro\meter} at at $CF_v=$~90\%.

\section{Simulations of four typical beamline beamline configurations}
\label{sec:complete-beamline}

In this section we analyse particular beamline focusing configurations. We calculate the intensity distribution at the focal plane for four cases. They have been selected from the results in Fig.~\ref{fig:focalSizes}. The first case is selected to obtain a small spot (about \SI{5}{\micro\meter}) and the second one a large spot (more than \SI{30}{\micro\meter}).  For these cases the slits are selected to match a $CF_h=CF_v=$~90\% for a photon energy of \SI{7}{keV}. The values are shown in Table~\ref{table:2Dusercases}. The cases 3 and 4 follow the same logic but the slits are opened to obtain a less coherent beam ($CF_h=CF_v=$~70\%).

We have recalculated the cases shown in Table~\ref{table:2Dusercases} using Wofry. We optimized manually some parameters, including the zoom factor for propagation in drift spaces. We then combined the 1D horizontal and vertical profiles (using the outer product) to form the 2D intensity profile at the focal plane. Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2DWofry1D}. We can observe in the intensity distributions a variety of features that are due to the diffraction effects. Case 1 shows an horizontal profile mostly triangular with shoulders that evidence small diffraction fringes. The fringes are more resolved in the vertical direction. Case 2  presents in horizontal a soft Gaussian-like profile, but in vertical important symmetric shoulders are remarked. Case 3 shows a smooth Gaussian profile in horizontal and a small shoulder with fringes in vertical. Case 4 shows a conventional smooth profile in horizontal but an original three-lobe plateau in vertical. This variety of profile distribution demonstrates how relevant the diffraction effects are, which modulate the beam shape in a non-trivial way.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


\subsection{$f_1$ $f_2$ trajectories and focal sizes} 

The focusing of the partial coherence x-ray beams produced by low emittance storage rings is a complex phenomenon, because diffraction effects induced by coherence modify significantly the  beam characteristics. The concepts of geometrical optics often used to calculate the focal position (lens equation) and the focal size (using magnification) fail when the x-ray beam is cropped significantly (reduced NA) (see Figs.~\ref{fig:f1f2map}, \ref{fig:focalSizes}).
The system studied here, based on the project for the new ID18 beamline at EBS-ESRF, will image directly the source to the focal plane (sample), using two focusing elements (paired transfocators). This is an innovative concept only possible thanks to the high coherence that the new storage rings provide. Beamlines in old synchrotrons always imaged the source into a secondary source at least in horizontal. The use of a secondary source is advantageous in terms of controlling the size with a slit and therefore the coherence, but the drastic reduction in distance source-sample reduces the benefits of the long beamlines. Also, bringing the source closer to the sample imply a larger beam divergence that affects negatively to the transmittivity. Transmittivity depends on the optical element acceptance, usually limited by the extremely good surface finish required. Indeed, in most nonofocusing beamlines (e.g. the ID16A beamline at ESRF \cite{ID16A, hierarchical}) the focal size is mainly defined by  the aperture which also limits the transmittivity to values close to the coherent fraction. At the ID18 beamline at the EBS-ESRF source, the goal is obtain a variable beam size, but keeping flux as high as possible. It is therefore driven by the requirements on coherence controlled by the slit. Imaging the source directly on the sample is much affected by the NA and beam coherence, as our results show. Note also that the ID18 will be able to work in other configurations not analyzed here, giving higher demagnification (with the transfocator 2 closer to the sample). It will also be possible to use a secondary source, the image of transfocator 1, placed close before transfocator 2.

For the EBS-ESRF, the horizontal coherent fraction is lower than the vertical one (Fig.~\ref{fig:cf_vs_aperture}). This implies the necessity of cropping the beam more horizontally than vertically to get $CF_h=CF_v$, thus the smaller NA induces more distortions in the beam. In the vertical direction, the beam must be less cropped, causing smaller beam distortion than in horizontal direction. The horizontal apertures used to obtain typical values of CF suitable for experiments (50-95 \%) do strongly affect the evolution of the beam, but are not small enough to consider the slit as a secondary source. This is manifested in the shift and degradation of the focus that the first transfocator creates (Fig.~\ref{fig:oneTFund}): whereas in vertical most of the typical apertures (down to \SI{227}{\micro\meter}) induce the optical system to image the source (at the ID center), in horizontal the slit aperture required to obtain $CF_h=$ 90\% provokes a "shifting" of the source from its real position (ID center) to the slit position. Although this shift of the focal position has been predicted and calculated before (see \citeasnoun{Tanaka:85} for Gaussian beams, or \citeasnoun{westfahl} for synchrotron beams) our calculations in Fig. 3 reveal two new facts: i) the shift exists but it is directed upstream to the position defined by the geometrical optics for the slit image (and not downstream to the lens position, as found for the systems analyzed in the references mentioned), and ii) the focal size is highly degraded (its size increases) when the beam focus is found in between the two positions defined by the geometrical optics.  

Pairing two transfocators consists in matching their focal distances to guarantee the focus at the desired focal plane (the sample position). By matching the lens equations of the two lenses, it is possible the analytical expression in Eq.~\ref{eq:twolens} permits to calculate $f_2$ as a function of $f_1$. This can be done for the two cases: with the source at the ID center (limit of high NA, no cropping) of with the source at the slit (pinhole limit when NA~$\rightarrow$~0). The analytical equations diverge at the position where lens-1 focuses onto lens-2.
Figure~\ref{fig:f1f2map} shows an asymptotic approach (for $f_1<$~\SI{25}{\meter} or $f_1>$~\SI{70}{\meter}) of the numerical results to geometrical optics results, mostly with source at the ID, but sometimes (with closed slit) to the case of the source at the slit position. However, this case is obtained in the horizontal direction with a reasonable aperture $a=$~\SI{40.4}{\micro\meter} (to reach good coherence $CF_h=$~90\%) but with a very small aperture in the vertical direction $a=$~\SI{25}{\micro\meter}, a less interesting setup because high coherence can be obtained with more opened slits without compromising transmission. 

Equation~\ref{eq:CMD} predicts analytical singularities in $f_2$ when lens-1 focuses on lens-2. The numerical results (Fig.~\ref{fig:f1f2map}) show smooth transition from one branch to another, softer for smaller NAs in the horizontal (Fig.~\ref{fig:f1f2map}a) but not relevant in the vertical (Fig.~\ref{fig:f1f2map}b). As NA is reduced, the inflexion point shifts from the position calculated with the source at the center of the ID to the source at the slit position. However, as discussed in the last paragraph, this shifting is evident in the horizontal for the usual slit openings, but is not yet relevant in vertical for common apertures. 

It is remarkable that the focal sizes calculated in Fig.~\ref{fig:focalSizes} differs considerably from the results of the geometrical optics, making it not adequate to estimate focal sizes using geometrical concepts driven by source demagnification. Only in some particular areas geometrical optics give good results: in horizontal around $f_1\approx$~\SI{30}{\meter}, and at  $f_1 <$~\SI{30}{\meter} in vertical. 

In summary, the numerical simulation of the $(f_1,f_2)$ trajectory maps present two characteristics: i) they asymptotically match the analytical positions for sufficiently high or small $f_1$, either the position obtained when the source is at ID (high NA) or when the source is at the slit (low NA), and ii) the analytical singularities found when lens-1 focuses on lens-2 are smoothed originating an inflexion point that shifts, when reducing the NA, from the analytical position considering the source at the center of the ID to the position with the source sitting at the slit.   

\subsection{Transmitted flux} We have limited our study to the focal sizes, but it can be complemented with focal flux. At \SI{7}{keV}, the undulator in the configuration selected emits a flux of 1.5 10$^{15}$ photons/s/0.1\%bw. Each of the three elements studied (slit, lens -1 and lens-2) absorb part of the flux. The estimation of the absorption by the slit can be done using simple geometrical arguments, and the absorption by the slits depend on the average Be thickness presented to the beam. The linear attenuation coefficient of Be at 7 keV is $\mu=$~\SI{3}{\centi\meter}$^{-1}$, giving 1.45\% attenuation for a \SI{50}{\micro\meter} thick layer (like lens thickness used in simulations\footnote{In the simulations the horizontal and vertical focusing are separated in two lenses, with accumulated thickness \SI{100}{\micro\meter} thus absorption 3\%}). For the case 1 simulations we extracted the absorption for the different absorbing elements (slit, lens-1 and lens-2) in the case of partial coherence and also for full coherence (see Table~\ref{table:absorption}).

We note a high absorption in lens-2, due to the fact that in this case the lens-2 is overilluminated, therefore the \SI{1}{\milli\meter} physical aperture absorbs considerably the beam.

\subsection{Accuracy of the focal position and depth of focus}
\label{sec:caustic}

We have calculated the beam evolution in the neighbourhood of the sample position for the four cases studied (see Fig.~\ref{fig:caustic}). From these plots one can obtain the position of the best focus and the depth of focus. In some cases there is a mismatch between the position of the best focus and its expected position (the sample position, at the zero abscissas). This effect, certainly due to an error in setting $f_2$, may have several origins. 

For pairing two transfocators, the algorithm chosen to calculate the $f_2$ value consist in analyzing the wavefront at the lens-2 position, find a corrector refractive object that would transform the incoming wavefront in a converging wavefront (see section \ref{sec:refractorCorrector}), and fit the radius at the center. We then get the $R_2$ and therefore the $f_2$ value. In addition, to obtain smooth $(f_1,f_2)$ curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:f1f2map} we have used a Gaussian slit (see section \ref{sec:gaussianslit}). It smears out the diffraction fringes, because in an ideallized system where a point source is focused at the sample position, the recorded intensity would correspond to the diffraction pattern of the slit, that can be considered as an "object" placed in the beam (see e.g. \cite{paganin_book}). The use of a Gaussian object implies that its diffraction pattern is a Gaussian with no diffraction fringes. 

For cases 1h, 1v, 3v (see  Fig.~\ref{fig:caustic}), there is a good agreement between the focal position obtained from the maximum of intensity on-axis (plotted at the top of the image) and our expected position (the zero in the plots). In some other cases (2v, 3h, 4h) the agreement is acceptable, taking into account that the observed depth of focus is of the order of meters. A small correction in $f_2$ would bring the best focus to its ideal position. This correction is necessary because we used a Gaussian slit for calculating $f_2$, thus neglecting some oscillations around the $(f_1,f_2)$ curves. There are two pathological cases where the algorithm used to calculate $f_2$ did not succeed: the cases 2h and 4v.
The error in $f_2$  for case 2h is also due to the oscillations in the $(f_1,f_2)$ and can be corrected, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:causticcorrection}a. However, case 4v cannot be corrected because we would need a divergent lens to bring the focus of $f_1$ to the sample position. Setting $R_2=f_2=\infty$ would reduce the beam size at the sample position (Fig.~\ref{fig:causticcorrection}b), but cannot get the best focus there. However, an ad-hoc defined refractive corrector in the place of lens-2 would do the job (Fig.~\ref{fig:causticcorrection}d).  

The depth of focus (measured as the distance where the peak value is reduced by 15\%) is larger than two meters (except for the cases 1v, 3v).

\subsection{Errors in optical surfaces}

The performance of X-ray optics in the new generation synchrotron beamlines is limited by the quality of the optical surfaces \cite{lengeler1999,Yabashi}. Finish errors can be divided in three families: i) height errors, associated with surface finishing (high spatial frequency), ii) figure errors, associated with deviations from ideal profile (e.g. bending, gravity sag, thermal deformations), and iii) slope errors or waviness, associated to medium spatial frequencies \cite{srio1992, signorato1997}. Finish errors in x-ray lenses can be measured by different techniques (eg. grating interferometry, x-ray speckle tracking or ptychography) and readily included in the simulations \cite{Celestre:mo5214}. Some profiles measured at ESRF using x-ray speckle tracking \cite{berujon2020} with height error RMS of the order of \SI{1}{\micro\meter} are used to verify that the focal spot produced by lenses with realistic errors is not degraded with respect to the ideal lens surface. 


The effect of finish errors in the white double-mirror system is also analyzed using a measured mirror meridional profile of \SI{2.5}{\nano\meter} height error RMS and \SI{140}{\nano\radian} RMS slope error. 

The heat load affect several elements of the beamline. For the beamline under consideration, the affected elements (white beam mirrors, and double-crystal monochromators) are not presented in our simulations. Finite element analysis of mirrors and crystals done for other EBS beamlines \cite{Brumund} show that the deformation height profile can be decomposed it two parts: an average bending that is possible to correct by a small readjustment of the focal length of the optical elements downstream the heated element, and a ``residual error" which remain after removing the averaged bending radius, and could only be corrected using adaptive optics. Wofry1D simulations using FEA-generated deformations at the first crystal of a monochromator placed just after the coherent slit showed no significant degradation of the focal spot, both in size and shape. This is mainly due to the low power transmitted by the coherent slit. We checked that the focused beam is almost unchanged when using a profile from FEA analysis with curvature of about \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} and residual slope errors of \SI{30}{\nano\radian}. 

\subsection{Selection of the transfocator configuration.} 
The results presented in this paper idealizes the transfocator with two orthogonal single lenses, each one focusing one direction (horizontal of vertical), with parabolic profiles and apex radii adjusted for the wanted focal length (via the usual $f=R/(2 N \delta$). The real transfocator will use a combination of one or several lenses to give a similar radius of curvature  ($R^{-1} = R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1} + ...$). Two independent transfocators can be used for focusing independently the horizontal and vertical planes. Also, combination of 2D lenses matching the higher radius could be combined with 1D lenses to correct the radius of the direction that requires a shorter focal distance. The combinations of the lenses in the transfocator will not match perfectly the exact focal distances, thus producing a focal position close to the exact focal position at sample location. Depending on the used lenses, a different absorption is due to the accumulated thickness of the individual lenses. For example, the lens radii for case 4 can be obtained in using 2D lenses adjusted to focus in vertical (three lenses with $R_1=$~\SI{5}{\milli\meter}, $R_2=$~\SI{2}{\milli\meter} and $R_3=$~\SI{1}{\milli\meter} to get $R=$~\SI{0.588}{\milli\meter}) then adding two more 1D lenses to adjust the horizontal ($R_1=$~\SI{5}{\milli\meter} and $R_1=$~\SI{1}{\milli\meter} to get $R=$~\SI{0.345}{\milli\meter}, values very close to the exact values from Table~\ref{table:2Dusercases}. We simulated this configuration and got similar profiles than the case studied previously, with small differences in FWHM (10\% or less) and obviously more absorption. The empty space in between the lenses is neglected, which is a good approximation unless effects of ``adiabatic" focusing are expected, which may be the case for sub-micron focii.    

% \subsection{Off-resonance} The simulations considered here where done for monochromatic radiation supposing the undulator tuned at the exact resonance (\SI{7}{keV}). This photon energy may not exactly correspond to the maximum of the emitted flux. Somme effects of out-resonance may appear when i) a ``pink" or not strictly monochromatic beam is used (in beamlines without monochromator or also using a high-band monochomator, as for example using multilayer), or ii) the undulator gap tuned by selecting the maximum of the intensity in a given aperture, thus corresponding to an energy value a bit lower (red-shifted) than exact resonance. The separation from the position of the maximum of intensity to the resonant energy increases when increasing the observation slit. In our case, this beamline will use a slit small enough to gain coherence, which implies that the maximum of the intensity is well approximated by the resonance energy, and it will use a crystal monochromator thus the beam can be considered as monochromatic, thus off-resonance effects are not appreciated. This has been checked numerically by averaging the intensity distribution at the sample position when scanning the photon energy around the resonance value ($7\pm0.1$~keV).   \todo{suppress this paragraph?}


\subsection{The measurement of coherence} We measured the beam coherence using the coherent fraction $CF$, an idea introduced by \citeasnoun{glass2017}. This parameter has a strict definition in the context of the CMD: $CF$ is the occupation of the first coherent mode ($\eta_0$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:occupation}). We verified that this strict definition give values close to the approximated $CF$ calculated as the phase space dimension ratio between the coherent undulator emission (zero emittance) over the convolution of the electron beam phase space and the undulator emission. The CMD gives also the possibility of propagating the modes and also recalculate the $CF$ after the slits and optical elements. The coherence slit selects the wanted coherence (90\% for cases 1 and 2; or 70\% for cases 3 and 4 in our study) but the absorption of the lenses can also increase a bit more the coherence at the sample: $CF_h=$~94, 94, 77, 77 $CF_v=$~97, 90, 77, 71 for cases 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 

Other common parameters to define the coherence are the degree of coherence and coherence length. The degree of (transversal) coherence is not a scalar but a function (see equation~\ref{eq:DTC}. The coherence length has not a strict definition and it is usually given as the ``width" of some cut of the coherence degree. We found more intuitive and practical to use the $CF$ as a measure of the coherence. However, a good idea of the coherence length at a given position along the beamline is also given by the FWHM of the first coherence mode (given in brackets in Table~\ref{table:comparison} for the four cases studied).

\subsection{Practical considerations} Simulations like those presented here could be very beneficial for beamline operation, for its optimization and quick setting.  Complicated  relationships exist between the beam parameters requested by users (beam size and coherent fraction) and the beamline configuration (undulator, slit and transfocator setting). Quick simulations as done by Wofry1D could be a helpful instrument for the beamline staff to get the desired configurations. The plots shown here (e.g., $CF$ vs slit size in Fig.~\ref{fig:cf_vs_aperture}, trajectories in Fig.~\ref{fig:f1f2map}, or final size in Fig.~\ref{fig:focalSizes} could be simulated on-line and compared with results presented as look-up tables with similar aspect. We are also considering the design of a digital twin that mimics the real transfocator systems to assist beamline setting. For that, the fast simulation using the CMD method developed in Wofry1D will be an integrated component.  

Some practical consequences can be directly deduced from the results shown here. For example, looking at Fig.~\ref{fig:focalSizes} one can observe that the same focal size can be obtained with different configurations. To get a similar size, it is better to prefer a large $f_1$ to avoid over-illuminating the lens-2 and increase transmission of lens-1. The transfocator design is simplified if we restrict the horizontal focal distance t to be smaller than the vertical $f_h>f_v$. Here, $f_v$ can be obtained with lenses focusing in 2D and $f_h$ by adding 1D lenses focusing in the horizontal plane.

In this work we configured the transfocator to have the resulting focal position on the sample plane, an "in-focus" setup. It could also be possible to work off-focus to vary the beam size at the sample plane. The in-focus setup will generally produce the sharpest image of very small details in the image. Moreover, it will reduce the artifacts produced by the surface finish errors. Also, a larger depth of focus is obtained at this position (see e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:causticcorrection}).

\todo{because of the system complexity it would be good to have an experimental method to guarantee that the focus sit on the image plane (so we are not out of focus)}



\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}

We have studied in detail the focusing of a partial coherent beam (as produced by the low emittance storage ring EBS-ESRF) by a system of one and two transfocators (or lenses). In agreement with existing works, we observe a displacement of a focal position originated by the reduction of NA. The reduction of NA is the result of closing a slit to gain coherence, a usual procedure in beamlines for X-ray coherence applications. We observed that good focusing (small focus) is obtained when its position coincide with the positions predicted by the geometrical optics (considering the source either at the ID position or at the slit position) but not in intermediate positions (Fig.~\ref{fig:oneTFundPartialCoherence}).

We calculated numerically the map or trajectory of focal distances $(f_1,f_2)$ needed to maintain the focus at the image plane. The beam size values obtained for different cases are very different than those predicted by geometrical optics.  

Numerical calculations have been done using coherent mode decomposition in 1D. This is a fast method, ideal for parametric calculations as presented here. OASYS workspaces for the simulations performed in this paper are available\footnote{{ https://github.com/srio/paper-transfocators-resources/tree/main/workspaces}}.
